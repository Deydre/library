## üå± Challenges Faced

- Carefully reviewing the route of specific lists in the **NY Times Books API** documentation and implementing the logic to dynamically attach it within each `addEventListener`, ensuring seamless connectivity with the unique ID of each button.
- Connecting with **Firebase Auth** and managing events across three buttons: **Log In, Logout,** and **Sign Up**. This required verifying that the authentication functionality was correctly reflected in Firebase.
- **Time management and organization**: Balancing project deadlines with effective planning and task prioritization to stay on track.


## üõ†Ô∏è Future Improvements

- **Email Validation with Regex**: Implement regex checks in the Sign Up and Log In forms to ensure valid email formatting.
- **User Verification on Sign In**: Check if a user exists in the system during sign-in, and display a warning if the user input is incorrect.
- **Favorites System**: Create a favorites feature linked to each user via **Firebase Firestore**. Add a complementary page where users can view and manage their favorite books.
- **Integration with Firebase Cloud Storage**: Allow users to upload profile pictures, storing the image URL in their Firebase Firestore document.
- **Search by List and Book Name**: Add search functionality for easy lookup of lists and specific books.
- **Book Category Filters**: Implement a filter system to sort books by category, making it easier for users to find relevant content.
